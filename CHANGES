	0.3-8 (18.02.2003)

	whichf is not needed in cases a complete cmatrix is specified

	df is always the ceiling(n - rankx)

	0.3-7 (12.02.2003)

	use which.{min,max} in csimtest (a report by Simon
        Wotherspoon <spoon@hilbert.maths.utas.edu.au>)

	<REMAINDER>
		take care of LINPACK argument in R-1.7.0
		for svd in mginv (wrt regression tests)
	</REMAINDER>

	0.3-6 (03.02.2003)

	malformed DEPENDS field

	0.3-5 (18.12.2002)

	R CMD build problems

	0.3-4 (22.11.2002)

	the package now owns a vignette
	depends mvtnorm >= 0.5-7

	0.3-3 (23.10.2002)

	documentation fixes

	0.3-2 (18.09.2002)

	is.integer(df) -> all.equal(df - floor(df), 0) in csim{int,test}

	0.3-1 (14.08.2002)

	plot method for simultaneous confidence intervals

	0.3-0 (22.07.2002)
 
        prepare for release: 
          * depends R-1.5.1 (TukeyHSD)
          * new *.Rout.save
          * renames ginv -> mginv to prevent warnings when loading MASS

	0.2-9 (12.07.2002)

        bugs fixed:
        - maxpts was defined statically in csimtest
	- dataset `recover' conflicts with `recover' in base, renamed to
	  `recovery'
	- check for interactions was broken in sim{int,test}.formula and
	  therefore the factor levels were not printed correctly
        - names where lost, print names and levels in print and summary

        improvements:
        - csimtest gives a warning if error of pmvt > eps
	- formula interface completly rewritten to handle an arbritary
          number of covariables, use `whichf' if more than one factor is
          specified.
        - modify the contrast matrices for intercepts and covariables in
          sim{test,int}.default -> need nzerocol as additional argument
        - summary.* now tells us the factor contrasts are computed for and 
          which covariables were used
        - ?simtest now documents the formula interface better and has a lot
          of (toy) examples
        - added comparision with TukeyHSD in simint.Rd

        Attention: old multcomp-test.Rout.save still in use to make sure
                   nothings goes wrong -> Rdiff has some output.

        0.2-6 (19.06.2002)

        First release for CRAN, cosmetics only.

        0.2-5 (17.06.2002)

        Comments from Peter added, typos and cosmetrics
        Prepare for first release.

        0.2-2 (10.04.2002)

        bugfix McDermott and nice labels in respiratory

        0.2-1 (08.04.2002)

        renamed package `mtest' to `multcomp'

        0.2-0 (08.04.2002)

        add meaningful labels to hmtestp-objects and some cosmetics

        0.1-12 (18.03.2002)

        csim{int,test}: nlevels, ... removed and documented.
        0.1-11 (14.03.2002)

        functions csimint, csimtest added for direct calucations with
        parameter estimates and covariance matrices (not yet documented)

        9.3.02 Respiratory Bsp geht jetzt. Beschreibung simtest,
        simint besser.

        0.1-10 (28.02.2002)

        added quantile to summary.hmtest

        Tetrade in waste example works now

        0.1-9 (21.02.2002)

        angina$dose is a factor

        compute nlevel for type=Tetrade in sim{int,test}.formula and pass
        them to sim{int,test}.default.

        renamed "nlevels" to "nlevel" (conflict with function nlevels())

        detergent${detergent,block} now are factors

        example(respiratory) throws an error in mvt ?!?

        dimensions does not fit in sim{int,test}.default when Tetrade is
        used

        {summary,print} for simtest results added


        0.1-8 (27.01.2002)

        changes labels in print/summary methods, alternative=c("two.sided",
        "less", "greater") is R-style, print only digits up to eps

        0.1-7 (22.01.2002)

        simint is now generic and has a nice formula based interface which
        handles the full design matrix (full.model.matrix.R removed). simint
        returns an object of class "hmtest" which has a print method.

        0.1-6 (27.10.2001)

        waste example added

        0.1-5 (21.09.2001)

        further improvments to full.model.matrix (colnames, attr etc)

        0.1-4 (20.09.2001)

        full.model.matrix returns singular ANOVA-design matrices from
        formula objects, included in simint.R (with formula based interface)


        0.1-3 (23.07.2001)

        simint.{R,Rd} added
        Williams, Ave, McDermott, Marcus added

        0.1-2 (09.07.2001)

        Williams, Ave, McDermott, Marcus added

        0.0-1 (08.07.2001)

        package `mtest' created, `contrMat' translated from SAS code by Frank
