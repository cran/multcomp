Subject: Bug report 2 (multcomp)

Hello I'm a post graduated student in Kumamoto University in Japan.
I hope that my contacting you is not an imposition in any way.

I sent you another bug report of multcomp before.
The previous bug report was that the number of "p adj" of simtest was  
increased
( because of the effects for levels problem).

This time bug report is that the number of "p adj" is not changed but  
one of "p adj" is gone !!
In addition, with simint , this outcome dosen't happen.

I think this time bug may be the same type, but I report you this for  
any help( bug checking or something ) .

I picked up an example below.
I hope that your success and everything goes well.
Thank you for using your package.
